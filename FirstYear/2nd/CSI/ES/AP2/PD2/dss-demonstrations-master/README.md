# DSS Standalone Application

In order to build the standalone application, the following modules are required:

 * dss-mock-tsa;
 * dss-standalone-app;
 * dss-standalone-package.
 
If the build is successful, you will be able to find out the following containers in the directory `/dss-standalone-app-package/target/`:

 * dss-standalone-app-package-minimal.zip - contains the application code. Requires JDK ad JavaFX installed on a target machine in order to run the application;
 * dss-standalone-app-package-complete.zip - contains the application code, as well as JDK and JavaFX library code. Can be run on a machine whithout pre-installed libraries.

In order to launch the application, you will need to extract the archive and run the file `dss-run.bat`.

# DSS Web Application

To build the DSS Web Application the following modules are required:

 * dss-mock-tsa;
 * dss-demo-webapp;
 * dss-demo-bundle.
 
After a successful build, in the directory `/dss-demo-bundle/target/` you will be able to find out two containers: `dss-demo-bundle.zip` and `dss-demo-bundle.tar.gz`. Despite the container type, the content of both files is the same. After extracting the content, you will need to run the file `Webapp-Startup.bat` in order to launch the server and the file `Webapp-Shutdown.bat` to stop the server. After running the server, the web-application will be available at the address `http://localhost:8080/`.
