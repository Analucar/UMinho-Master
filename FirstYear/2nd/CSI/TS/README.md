### :books: Tecnologias de Segurança
***
In this subject we developed 3 different projects.

- **(19,5/20)** This first project is divided into two independent parts, the first part consists in the use of techniques for passive scanning as a tool for analyzing the security in real systems and infrastructures. In the second part, we used active scanning tools and techniques to identify vulnerabilities and weaknesses in a remote system.
- **(20/20)** This second project consisted in analysing, identifying and describing potential security weaknesses to which the system may be exposed.
- **(17/20)** In the third project was asked to implement a software component capable of detecting modifications in a set of files that are critical for the security of a linux operating system.
