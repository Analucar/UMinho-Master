### :books: Estruturas Criptográficas
***
In this subject we developed 4 different projects.

- **(18/20)** In the first project was asked to:
  - Create an asynchronous private communication between an Emitter agent and a Receiver agent;
  - Create a cipher with metadata authentication from a PRG.
- **(19/20)** In the second project was asked to:
  - Implement an AEAD with “Tweakable Block Ciphers”;
  - Build a Python class that implements a KEM-RSA;
  - Build a Python class that implements EdCDSA from the “standard” FIPS186-5.
- **(19/20)** In the third project was asked to create 3 prototypes in Sagemath for three techniques from each families of post-quantum cryptosystems: BIKE (“code based”), NTRU (“lattice based”) and KYBER (“LWE based”). For each of these techniques it is intended to implement a KEM, that is IND-CPA secure, and a PKE that is IND-CCA secure.
- **(19/20)** In the fourth project was asked to
  - Create 2 prototypes in Sagemath for the Dilithium and Rainbow algorithms;
  - Implement Schnorr's algorithm in Sagemath.
