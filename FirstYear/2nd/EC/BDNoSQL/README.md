In this subject we developed 1 different projects, one group project and one individual project.

- **(19/20)** The **individual project** consisted in investigating Big Data “tools” by defining which are the most suitable for the use case ("Covid-19 and the workplace") and developping an architecture (including the investigated “tools”) that allows us to obtain metrics that measure the influence that the Covid-19 pandemic had on the workplace.
- **(19/20)** The **group project**, similar to the individual project, consisted in implementing an architecture that allows us to obtain metrics that measure the influence that the Covid-19 pandemic had on the use case (Covid-19 and the willingness to stay at home).
